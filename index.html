            <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
        
            <p>Will AI take your job, make you incredibly wealthy, or crash the global economy? This isn't just a hypothetical question for the distant future; it's the central investment question of our time. I call it <strong>The Great Divergence</strong>.</p>
            <p>To navigate it, we need a framework for three possible futures: a "Boom," a "Bust," or a "Balance." This blog post is inspired by the cover story of the July 2025 edition of The Economist, "<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/07/24/the-economics-of-superintelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Economics of Superintelligence</a>." <a href="#source-1">[1]</a> Hereâ€™s my take on how to think about these scenarios, and more importantly, how to position yourself for what's coming. While none of what follows is financial advice, I share my thought process in the hope it might benefit others who feel this duality of being absolutely amazed by what's possibly ahead of us, while simultaneously having a healthy respect for a future with maybe life-changing disruption.</p>

            <div class="takeaways-box">
                <h3>Key Takeaways: Navigating the Great Divergence</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Three Futures:</strong> AI will likely lead to one of three scenarios: a hyper-productive "Boom," a chaotic "Bust," or a manageable "Balance."</li>
                    <li><strong>Watch the Indicators:</strong> Don't just guess. Track concrete signals like AI-led scientific discoveries and specific inflation patterns to see which future is unfolding.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Barbell Strategy:</strong> Since the future is uncertain, the most robust investment strategy is a "barbell"â€”a diversified core for the "Balance" scenario, with smaller, targeted bets on the "Boom" (e.g., AI leaders) and the "Bust" (e.g., hard assets).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        
            <h3 id="three-scenarios">The Three Scenarios</h3>
            
            <p>Will we face a scenario in which AI surpasses human cognitive abilities, self-improves and automates discovery itself, leading to an unprecedented economic boom? Would chaotic socio-political fallout be the consequence? Or are we going to experience a powerful, evolutionary force, more like the Internet than an instantaneous revolution? Each has different winners and losers, which is why I call it "The Great Divergence."</p>
            
            <h4 id="scenario-boom">Scenario 1: The Supercharged Growth, a.k.a. the "Boom"</h4>
            <img src="Images/boom.png" alt="A city skyline with data streams shooting upwards, representing a boom" class="scenario-image-embedded">
            <p>In this scenario, as per The Economist, AI achieves Super-intelligence, becoming better than humans at pretty much all cognitive tasks. This ignites an explosion of economic growth, potentially exceeding 20% annually, driven by AI autonomously making technological discoveries. As a result, the cost of anything AI can produce (from digital entertainment to factory goods) collapses. Also, this devalues most human labor, leading to a massive wealth transfer to the "owners of relevant capital."</p>
            <p>For this to happen, a couple of things need to be true:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>AI must become capable of autonomous technological discovery without significant human input.</li>
                <li>Computing power must continue to scale and be the primary input for this AI-driven discovery. Alternatively, a shift from the current LLM architecture to something like Yann LeCun's JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture) would have to happen, possibly mitigating the need for bigger scale. <a href="#source-2">[2]</a></li>
                <li>A "winner-take-all" dynamic must play out, with a few corporations or nations dominating the AI landscape.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 id="scenario-bust">Scenario 2: The Macroeconomic Instability, a.k.a. the "Bust"</h4>
            <img src="Images/bust.png" alt="A city skyline with a crashing stock chart, representing a bust" class="scenario-image-embedded">
            <p>Once the supercharged growth reality sets in, the anticipation of immense future wealth would cause people to "binge" on spending, igniting massive inflation. Central banks fail to react quickly enough. Soaring inequality between the capital-owning class and the rest of the population leads to intense political pressure for redistribution, creating a volatile and unpredictable political environment. The article warns that "politics would therefore be volatile" and mentions the risk of capital flight from countries unable to manage the transition.</p>
            <p>This scenario is contingent on The Boom unfolding first, therefore we'd expect to see the following prerequisites being in place:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Supercharged Growth Scenario must begin to materialize.</li>
                <li>Human consumer behavior must be forward-looking, leading to a spending boom before the supply of goods and services fully adjusts.</li>
                <li>Central banks and governments must fail to manage the resulting inflation and social tensions effectively.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 id="scenario-balance">Scenario 3: The Muddle Through, a.k.a. the "Balance"</h4>
            <img src="Images/balance.png" alt="A human face and a robot face in profile, representing balance" class="scenario-image-embedded">
            <p>In Economics it's often a reasonable assumption that the near future looks a lot like the recent past, which is what we'll go with here: AI continues to make people's lives easier on a personal level and will continue to creep into the business world one application or platform at a time, but won't trigger a Cambrian explosion of intelligence. This would lead to a much more moderate annual growth of maybe 2-5% GDP for the foreseeable future.</p>
            <p>So what would have to happen for the world to conserve the status-quo?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>AI develops as augmentation, not as autonomous replacement, enhancing human skills rather than making human cognition obsolete.</li>
                <li>The economic benefits from AI-driven productivity are broad based, not captured by a tiny fraction of capital owners. This would happen through higher wages for "augmented" jobs, effective tax and transfer policies, or other ways to prevent the extreme rise in inequality.</li>
                <li>Governments and regulatory bodies must successfully navigate a middle path, creating policies that foster innovation while managing risks like job displacement and privacy concerns.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The "Balance" scenario seems like a good starting point in late July 2025. However, we see some signs of the "Boom" scenario (e.g., OpenAI's "winner-take-all" dynamic <a href="#source-3">[3]</a>). So let's start with an arbitrary <b>65% chance of Balance</b> and a <b>35% chance of Boom</b>. We omit the Bust for now, as it's contingent on the Boom.

            <h3 id="investment-themes">Possible investment themes</h3>
            
            <h4>Muddling Through</h4>
            <p>I'll start with the most likely scenario as per my probability assessment above. Things broadly continue as they are now: P(muddling through)=65%.</p>
            <p>The core investment philosophy here is to avoid making extreme bets. You don't need to hide in gold (like in a Bust), nor do you need to bet everything on a handful of AI labs winning it all (like in a supercharged, AI dominated growth world). Instead, the goal is to invest in the broad and profitable adoption of AI across the entire economy.</p>
            <p>A Core-Satellite portfolio structure seems like a good option for this environment.</p>
            <p><strong>Core Portfolio (Approx. 70-80% of Assets)</strong><br>
            This forms the stable foundation of your portfolio, designed to capture broad, long-term economic growth which is now modestly accelerated by AI.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Asset Class</strong>: Global Equities & Quality Bonds.</li>
                <li><strong>Investment Idea</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Broad Market ETFs: Instead of trying to pick the ultimate winner, own the world. A low-cost global equity index fund (like one tracking the MSCI World or FTSE Global All-Cap Index) is the cornerstone. This ensures exposure to all developed and emerging markets as they adopt AI at their own pace.</li>
                        <li>Investment Grade Bonds: In a "Muddle Through" world, inflation is contained and interest rates are not spiraling to 30%. Bonds revert to their traditional role of providing diversification and income. A mix of government and high-quality corporate bonds will provide stability against normal market corrections.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            <p><strong>Satellite Portfolio (Approx. 20-30% of Assets)</strong><br>
            This is where targeted bets on the specific themes of the AI-enhanced economy happen, without taking on too much speculative risk.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Asset Class</strong>: Thematic Equities & Sectors.</li>
                <li><strong>Investment Idea</strong>:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>AI Adopters, Not Just Creators</strong>: This is the single most important theme. The biggest winners may not be the AI labs themselves, but the established, high-quality companies that use AI to create an insurmountable competitive advantage.
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>What to look for</strong>: Look for market leaders in "boring" but essential industries that are explicitly investing in AI to improve their operations. Listen to earnings calls for mentions of AI-driven margin improvement, supply chain optimization, and predictive maintenance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Sectors</strong>: Industrials & Logistics, Healthcare, Financials, Consumer Staples.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>The "Picks and Shovels" Ecosystem</strong>: The infrastructure enabling the AI boom seems to be a valid investment, as its demand is more predictable than the success of any single AI model.
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Sectors</strong>: Semiconductors & Hardware, Energy & Utilities, Cybersecurity.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>What to Avoid in This Scenario</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hyper-Speculative "Pure Play" AI Stocks: Companies with a story but no profits.</li>
                <li>Concentrated Bets: Going all-in on one or two AI labs or tech giants is unnecessarily risky.</li>
                <li>Being Overly Defensive: Hiding in cash or gold would mean missing out on significant productivity gains.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Supercharged growth</h4>
            <p>This is our future in which AI surpasses human cognitive abilities and automates discovery itself, leading to an unprecedented economic boom with annual GDP growth of up to 25%.</p>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Asset Class</strong>: Capital that directly enables AI (e.g. venture capital, private equity).</li>
                <li><strong>Sectors/Companies</strong>: AI Infrastructure, Scarce Human Services.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Macroeconomic instability</h4>
            <p>Flight to safety is the name of the game here. With societal and economic chaos ensuing, real assets will play an important role.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Asset Class</strong>: Real assets that serve as a hedge against inflation and political instability.</li>
                <li><strong>Sectors/Companies</strong>: Hard Assets (Gold), Inflation-Resistant Sectors (Consumer Staples), Volatility Trading.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="one-world">One world, one portfolio?</h3>
            <p>One could get really fancy here and think about how the three scenarios play out for different regions or countries. A few drivers come to mind that could define a geographical fine-tuning. Being from Germany, here's how I think about it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regulation</strong>: Europe's AI Act may slow the "Supercharged Growth" scenario compared to the US, making the "Muddle Through" scenario more likely within the EU.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial Base</strong>: Germany's strength is in its Mittelstand and high-end manufacturing. These companies are prime candidates to be world-leading "AI Adopters."</li>
                <li><strong>Currency & Central Bank</strong>: The ECB may be more or less aggressive than the US Federal Reserve. The risk of capital flight from Europe to the US is a real threat in the "Boom" scenario.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Speaking of currencies, the following table summarizes potential impacts on major currencies.</p>

                        <td>Volatile but likely Valued Higher on a relative basis. In a "risk-off" global crisis, the USD acts as the ultimate safe-haven asset due to the liquidity of its Treasury market, even if its domestic purchasing power is eroded by inflation. Capital flees weaker nations for the perceived safety of the US.</td>
                        <td>Normal Volatility. The USD might have a slight upward bias due to its tech leadership, but currency values would be driven by traditional factors like interest rate differentials between the Fed and ECB. No extreme, one-way movement.</td>

                        <td>Valued Lower (Significantly). High inflation combined with severe political strife over redistribution would make the Eurozone deeply unattractive to international capital. The risk of a sovereign debt crisis for some member states would re-emerge, punishing the currency.</td>
                        <td>Normal Volatility. The EUR's value would be determined by the ECB's monetary policy relative to other central banks and the overall economic health of the Eurozone. Its performance would be based on the successful adoption of AI by its industries.</td>

            <p>I mentioned the absence of a crystal ball earlier. This leads to what's sometimes called a "Barbell Portfolio". Since you cannot be certain which scenario will unfold, a more diversified approach is to build a portfolio that can benefit from the most likely scenario while being hedged for the extremes.</p>
            
            <div class="barbell-container">

            <p>This blended, probability-aware approach is likely more robust than simply picking a single scenario and hoping it comes true.</p>
        
            <h2 id="dynamism">Dynamism</h2>
            <p>But since you're still here, we might as well come back to the concept of updating our beliefs over time and how that would impact portfolio composition.</p>
            <p>We'll structure this chapter around the three core investment themes derived from our scenarios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Theme A: Concentrated Hyper-Growth (The "Supercharged Growth" Strategy)</li>
                <li>Theme B: Chaos & Inflation Hedge (The "Macroeconomic Instability" Strategy)</li>
                <li>Theme C: Broad-Based Quality Growth (The "Muddle Through" Strategy)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Let's start from a fictitious initial state portfolio allocation (as of July 31, 2025). This portfolio reflects a world with high potential for AI but no definitive breakthrough yet. The most likely outcome is a continued "muddle through," but with a good chance for a paradigm shift.</p>

            <p><strong>Initial Scenario Probabilities</strong>:<br>
            P(Scenario 3: Muddle Through) = 65%<br>
            P(Scenario 1: Supercharged Growth) = 35%<br>
            P(Scenario 2: Instability) = 0% (this is contingent on Scenario 1, so its probability is zero until Scenario 1 begins)</p>
            
            <p>Based on these probabilities, a logical <strong>portfolio allocation</strong> would be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Theme C: Broad-Based Quality Growth: 65%</li>
                <li>Theme A: Concentrated Hyper-Growth: 35%</li>
                <li>Theme B: Chaos & Inflation Hedge: 0%</li>
            </ul>
            <hr style="border-color: #333;">

            <p>After watching this portfolio for 6 boring months without much action, in late 2025, a substantial change occurs, confirming a core tenet of the "Supercharged Growth" scenario.</p>
            <p><strong>The Event</strong>: A consortium of AI labs announces their latest model has independently made a breakthrough scientific discovery that is immediately verifiable by human expertsâ€”for example, designing a novel protein that effectively neutralizes a wide range of viruses. The discovery is published in Nature, with the AI model credited as the primary contributor.</p>
            <p><strong>The Impact</strong>: This event fundamentally alters the landscape. It proves that AI is no longer just an augmentative tool but an autonomous engine of discovery. The probability of the "Muddle Through" scenario drastically decreases, while the probability of "Supercharged Growth" becomes the base case. As a direct consequence, the market begins to price in the possibility of future disruption, giving the "Instability" scenario its first non-zero probability.</p>
            <p>This leads to a portfolio re-allocation. The portfolio must be restructured to reflect the new reality.</p>
            <p><strong>Updated Scenario Probabilities</strong>:<br>
            P(Scenario 1: Supercharged Growth) = 50% (Now the most likely path)<br>
            P(Scenario 3: Muddle Through) = 45% (Still possible, but no longer the base case)<br>
            P(Scenario 2: Instability) = 5% (A small but critical risk that must now be hedged)</p>
            <p>The new allocation reflects a major strategic shift:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Theme A: Concentrated Hyper-Growth: 50%</li>
                <li>Theme C: Broad-Based Quality Growth: 45%</li>
                <li>Theme B: Chaos & Inflation Hedge: 5%</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>To summarize, here's the before-and-after comparison:</p>

            <p>This concludes our little "tour de force" about the Great Divergence and how to maneuver it. You're now equipped with a framework to think about scenarios in probabilities and, crucially, in signs that would (in-)validate hypotheses about the future unfolding. We then looked at possible winners and losers, which led to investment themes for each possible future. Combined with the knowledge about probabilities and how to update them, a hypothetical portfolio was constructed and a mechanism to update it based on events was introduced.
            <br>
            It's now up to you if you stop here and pat yourself on the back for having learned something or if you want to act on what you learned. Either way, the part about portfolio construction needs to be tailored to your needs, abilities, and risk profile. So that's your missionâ€”should you choose to accept it.</p>

            <p>But this framework is a living document, not a final answer. The most valuable insights often come from collective intelligence.</p>
